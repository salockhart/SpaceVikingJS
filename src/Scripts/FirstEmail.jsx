		Hello Warrior.<br />
		I am <span className="red">Odin</span>, The All-Father.<br />
		<br />
		You have been in cryostasis since the <span className="blue">Information Age</span>. It is the year <span className="blue">20XX PA (Post-Armageddon)</span>, and you are drifting aboard the <span className="cyan">NS Fjord VValkyrie</span>. Your vessel and crew have succumb to a <span className="yellow">terrible fate</span>.<br />
		<br />
		Your crew was returning home from a raid on <span className="green">Neo-Dublin</span> when an unexpected nuclear fish-salting accident occurred and the main core overheated and caused a great explosion.<br />
		<br />
		Every member of your crew was either mutated or killed in the explosion and are now roaming the halls of this vessel, and may prove <span className="red">dangerous</span>.<br />
